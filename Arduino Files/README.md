You'll need following libraries for your arduino:
1. Adafruit DHT library = https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/simple-dht
2. Adafruit Common sensor library = https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor
3. SST library = https://github.com/Saizenki/SST_liquid_sensor
4. OneWire library= https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/one-wire
5. DallasTemperature library=https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/dallas-temperature
6. Adafruit AM2315 library= https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/adafruit-am2315
7. Wire library= Inbuilt (I think so)
